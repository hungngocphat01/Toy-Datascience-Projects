# _Love Live!_ artist participation analysis

The goal of this project is to measure the influence of the artists that have participated in music production of the _Love Live!_ franchise.   
This is a simple project for practicing my data collection and data preprocessing skills. Steps are as follow:

1. Download all HTML profile of all _Love Live!_ songs ever existed from `ll-fans.jp`.  
  Download all HTML profile of all artists that have worked for the _Love Live!_ projects.
2. Read and parse above HTML files, transform into structured tables `artist` and `songs`.
3. Join above tables and perform simple analysis (e.g. grouping, visualization, etc.)
4. Communicate my findings (with my fellow _Love Live!_ fans).
