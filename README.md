# Simple Data Science projects

This repository consists of my simple data science projects, each in its own separated branch.

## List
- `LL-Anime-Score-Stats`: for each pair of animes in the following list, determine whether animes from that project are better than the others using 2-tailed hypothesis testing with mean score gathered from MAL: "Love Live!", "Love Live! Sunshine!", "Love Live! Nijigasaki", "Love Live! Superstar!!", "iM@S", "iM@S CG", "Bandori".
- `honokanon`: build a ConvNet based on MobileNet v2 to predict whether an image is of Shibuya Kanon or Kousaka Honoka.
- `LL-Youtube-Trend`: estimate the "fanbase development speed" of Bandori and Love Live! by approximating the cummulative sum of official video view count in each month from 12/2011 to 11/2021, then build a linear regression model to make predictions until 2031.
- `LL-Game-Stats`: compare approximated sales of several Japanese mobile games: SIF, SIFAS, Bandori, iM@S CG, SIFAS.
- `LL-Seiyuu-MAL-Count`: analyze number of roles undertaken by each Love Live! seiyuu. Data scraped from MyAnimeList.
- `LL-Songs`: analyze each franchise staff's role (composer, arranger, etc.) in the process of making Love Live! songs. Data scraped from LL-Fans.
- `LL-Clustering`: better not to be discussed.
